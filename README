Open eclipse in a new workspace, say:

    /home/john/java/audiobox


Move to the workspace and verify that .metadata folder is created

    cd /home/john/java/audiobox
    ls -al
    
    [84 ~/java/audiobox]
    [keytwo@kahlan $] > ls -al

    drwxr-xr-x  4 john john 4,0K 2010-07-06 19:33 .metadata


It's now time to clone the repos:

    git clone git@github.com:audiobox/AudioBox.fm-JavaLib.git .
    
    
If everything goes fine you have now a copy of the master branch, to switch to the edge simply enter:

    git checkout branch
    
    
Now you should be into edge branch, you are ready to start:


    mvn install eclipse:eclipse
